<h2>Recent News</h2>

<a name="2011_november_01"></a><h3>2011-November-01 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_9.html">Version 3.7.9</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_9.html">version 3.7.9</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.3, 3.7.7, 3.7.7.1, and 3.7.8 is optional.
  Upgrading from other versions is recommended.</p>

<p>  The <a href="compile.html#enable_stat2">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2</a> compile-time option is no a no-op.  The enhanced
  query-planner functionality formerly available using SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2
  is now available through <a href="compile.html#enable_stat3">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3</a>.  The enhanced query planning
  is still disabled by default.  However, future releases of SQLite might
  convert STAT3 from and enable-option to a disable-option so that it is 
  available by default and is only omitted upon request.</p>

<p>  The <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> full-text search engine has been enhanced such that tokens in
  the search string that begin with "" must be the first token in their
  respective columns in order to match.   Formerly, "" characters in the
  search string were simply ignored.  Hence, if a legacy application was
  including "" characters in FTS4 search strings, thinking that they would
  always be ignored, then those legacy applications might break with this
  update.  The fix is simply remove the "" characters from the search 
  string.</p>

<p>  See the <a href="releaselog/3_7_9.html">change summary</a> for additional changes associated
  with this release.  
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011_september_19"></a><h3>2011-September-19 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_8.html">Version 3.7.8</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_8.html">version 3.7.8</a> is a quarterly maintenance release.  Upgrading from
  versions 3.7.6.3, 3.7.7, or 3.7.7.1 is optional.  Upgrading from other
  versions is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release features a new "external merge sort" algorithm used to
  implement ORDER BY and GROUP BY and also to presort the content of an
  index for CREATE INDEX.  The new algorithm does approximately the same
  number of comparisons and I/Os as before, but the I/Os are much more
  sequential and so runtimes are greatly reduced when the size of the
  set being sorted is larger than the filesystem cache.  The performance 
  improvement can be dramatic - orders of magnitude faster 
  for large CREATE INDEX commands.  On the other hand, 
  the code is slightly slower (1% or 2%)
  for a small CREATE INDEX.  Since CREATE INDEX is not an
  operation that commonly occurs on a speed-critical path, we feel that 
  this tradeoff is a good one.  The slight slowdown for small CREATE INDEX
  statements might be recovered in a future release.  ORDER BY and GROUP BY
  operations should now be faster for all cases, large and small.</p>

<p>  The query planner has been enhanced to do a better job of handling
  the DISTINCT keyword on SELECT statements.</p>

<p>  There has been a lot of work on the default <a href="vfs.html">VFSes</a>.  The unix VFS has
  been enhanced to include more overrideable system calls - a feature requested
  by Chromium to make it easier to build SQLite into a sandbox.  The
  windows VFS has been enhanced to be more resistant to interference from
  anti-virus software.</p>

<p>  Every version of SQLite is better tested than the previous, and 3.7.8
  is no exception to this rule.  Version 3.7.8 has been used internally by
  the SQLite team for mission critical functions and has performed flawlessly.
  And, of course, it passes our rigorous <a href="testing.html">testing</a> procedures with no
  problems detected.  Version 3.7.8 is recommended for all new development.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011_june_28"></a><h3>2011-June-28 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_7_1.html">Version 3.7.7.1</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_7_1.html">version 3.7.7.1</a> adds a one-line bug fix to 3.7.7 to fix
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/25ee812710">a problem</a>
  causing <a href="pragma.html#pragma_case_sensitive_like">PRAGMA case_sensitive_like</a> statements compiled using the legacy
  <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> interface to fail with an <a href="c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_SCHEMA</a> error. Because
  <a href="c3ref/exec.html">sqlite3_exec()</a> uses sqlite3_prepare() internally, the problem also affects
  sqlite3_exec().</p>

<p>  Upgrading from 3.7.7 is only required for applications that use "PRAGMA
  case_sensitive_like" and the sqlite3_prepare() (or sqlite3_exec()) interface.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011_june_24"></a><h3>2011-June-24 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_7.html">Version 3.7.7</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_7.html">version 3.7.7</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release.  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.3 is optional.  Upgrading from all
  prior releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release adds support for naming database files using <a href="uri.html">URI filenames</a>.
  URI filenames are disabled by default (for backwards compatibility) but
  applications are encouraged to enable them since incompatibilities are
  likely to be exceedingly rare and the feature is useful.  See the 
  <a href="uri.html">URI filename documentation</a> for details.</p>

<p>  Most of the other enhancements in this release involve 
  <a href="vtab.html">virtual tables</a>.  The virtual table interface has been enhanced to
  support <a href="lang_savepoint.html">SAVEPOINT</a> and <a href="lang_conflict.html">ON CONFLICT</a> clause processing, and the built-in 
  <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a> and <a href="fts3.html">FTS3/FTS4</a> have been augmented to take advantage of 
  the new capability.  This means, for example, that it is now possible
  to use the <a href="lang_replace.html">REPLACE</a> command on <a href="fts3.html">FTS3/FTS4</a> and <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a> tables.</p>

<p>  The <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> full-text index extension has been enhanced to support
  the <a href="fts3.html#fts4prefix">FTS4 prefix option</a> and the <a href="fts3.html#fts4order">FTS4 order option</a>.  These two enhancements
  are provided in support of search-as-you-type interfaces where search
  results begin to appear after the first keystroke in the "search" box
  and are refined with each subsequent keystroke.  The way this is done is
  to do a separate full-text search after each key stroke, and add the
  "*" wildcard at the end of the word currently being typed.  So, for
  example, if the text typed so far is "fast da" and the next character
  typed is "t", then the application does a full-text search of the
  pattern "fast dat*" and displays the results.  Such capability has
  always existed.  What is new is that the <a href="fts3.html#fts4prefix">FTS4 prefix option</a> allows
  the search to be very fast (a matter of milliseconds) even for difficult
  cases such as "t*" or "th*".</p>

<p>  There has been a fair amount of work done on the FTS4 module for this
  release.  But the core SQLite code has changed little and the previous
  release has not given any problems, so we expect this to be a very
  stable release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011_may_19"></a><h3>2011-May-19 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_6_3.html">Version 3.7.6.3</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_6_3.html">version 3.7.6.3</a> is a patch release that fixes a 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/2d1a5c67df">single bug</a>
  associated with <a href="wal.html">WAL mode</a>.  The bug has been in SQLite ever since WAL
  was added, but the problem is very obscure and so nobody has noticed
  before now.  Nevertheless, all users are encouraged to upgrade to
  version 3.7.6.3 or later.</p>

<p>  The bug is this:
  If the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> is set very small (less than 10) and SQLite comes
  under memory pressure and if a multi-statement transaction is started
  in which the last statement prior to COMMIT is a SELECT statement and if
  a <a href="wal.html#ckpt">checkpoint</a> occurs right after the transaction commit, then
  it might happen that the transaction will be silently rolled back instead
  of being committed.</p>

<p>  The default setting for <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> is 2000. So in most situations, this
  bug will never appear.  But sometimes programmers set <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> to
  very small values on gadgets and other low-memory devices in order to
  save memory space.  Such applications are vulnerable.
  Note that this bug does <u>not</u> cause database corruption.  It is
  as if <a href="lang_transaction.html">ROLLBACK</a> were being run instead of <a href="lang_transaction.html">COMMIT</a> in some cases.</p>

<p>  <b>Bug Details</b></p>

<p>  Transactions commit in WAL mode by adding a record onto the end of
  the WAL (the write-ahead log) that contains a "commit" flag.  So to
  commit a transaction, SQLite takes all the pages that have changed
  during that transaction, appends them to the WAL, and sets the commit
  flag on the last page.  Now, if SQLite comes under memory pressure, it
  might try to free up memory space by writing changed pages to the WAL
  prior to the commit.  We call this "spilling" the cache to WAL.  There 
  is nothing wrong with spilling cache to WAL.  But if the
  memory pressure is severe, it might be that by the time <a href="lang_transaction.html">COMMIT</a> is run,
  all changed pages for the transaction have already been spilled to WAL
  and there are no pages left to be written to WAL.
  And with no unwritten pages, there was nothing to put the commit flag
  on.  And without a commit flag, the transaction would end up being
  rolled back.</p>

<p>  The fix to this problem was that if all changed pages has already
  been written to the WAL when the commit was started, then page 1 of
  the database will be written to the WAL again, so that there will always
  be a page available on which to set the commit flag.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_6_2.html">version 3.7.6.2</a> adds a one-line bug fix to 3.7.6.1 that enables
  pthreads to work correctly on NetBSD.  The problem was a faulty function
  signature for the open system call.  The problem does not appear to have
  any adverse impact on any system other than NetBSD.</p>

<p>  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.1 is only needed on NetBSD.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_6.html">version 3.7.6</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release of SQLite.  Upgrading from version 3.7.5 is optional.  Upgrading
  releases prior to 3.7.5 is recommended.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_5.html">version 3.7.5</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release of SQLite.  Due to the discovery and fix of 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/tktview?name=5d863f876e">an obscure bug</a>
  that could cause database corruption, upgrading from all prior
  releases of SQLite is recommended.  This bug was found during code
  review and has not been observed in the wild.</p>

<p>  This release adds new <a href="c3ref/c_dbstatus_options.html#sqlitedbstatuslookasidehit">opcodes</a> for the
  <a href="c3ref/db_status.html">sqlite3_db_status()</a> interface that allow more precise measurement of
  how the <a href="malloc.html#lookaside">lookaside memory allocator</a> is performing, which can be useful
  for tuning in applications with very tight memory constraints.</p>

<p>  The <a href="c3ref/mprintf.html">sqlite3_vsnprintf()</a> interface was added.  This routine is simply
  a varargs version of the long-standing <a href="c3ref/mprintf.html">sqlite3_snprintf()</a> interface.</p>

<p>  The output from <a href="c3ref/profile.html">sqlite3_trace()</a> interface has been enhanced to work
  better (and faster) in systems that use recursive extensions such as
  <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> or <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a>.</p>

<p>  Testing with Valgrind shows that this release of SQLite is about 1%
  or 2% faster than the previous release for most operations.</p>

<p>  A fork of the popular ADO.NET adaptor for SQLite known as System.Data.SQLite
  is now available on <a href="http://System.Data.SQLite.org/">http://System.Data.SQLite.org/</a>.  The originator
  of System.Data.SQLite, Robert Simpson, is aware of this fork, has
  expressed his approval, and has commit privileges on the new Fossil
  repository.  The SQLite development team intends to maintain
  System.Data.SQLite moving forward.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_4.html">version 3.7.4</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release of SQLite.  Upgrading from <a href="releaselog/3_7_2.html">version 3.7.2</a> and <a href="releaselog/3_7_3.html">version 3.7.3</a>
  is optional.  Upgrading from all other SQLite releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release features <a href="fts3.html">full-text search</a> enhancements.  The older 
  <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> virtual table is still fully supported, and should also run
  faster.  In addition, the new <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> virtual table is added.  FTS4
  follows the same syntax as FTS3 but holds additional metadata which
  facilitates some performance improvements and more advanced 
  <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo()</a> output.  Look for further full-text search enhancements
  in subsequent releases.</p>

<p>  Also in this release, the <a href="eqp.html">EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</a> output has been enhanced
  and new documentation is provided so that application developers can
  more easily understand how SQLite is performing their queries.</p>

<p>  Thanks to an account from the folks at <a href="http://www.devio.us/">http://www.devio.us/</a>, OpenBSD
  has been added to the list of platforms upon which we 
  <a href="testing.html">test SQLite</a> prior to every release.  That list of platforms
  now includes:</p>

<p>  <ul>
  <li> Linux x86 &amp; x86_64
  <li> MacOS 10.5 &amp; 10.6
  <li> MacOS 10.2 PowerPC
  <li> WinXP and Win7
  <li> Android 2.2
  <li> OpenBSD 4.7
  </ul></p>

<p>  The previous release of SQLite (<a href="releaselog/3_7_3.html">version 3.7.3</a>) has proven to be very
  robust.  The only serious issue discovered was
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/80ba201079">ticket 80ba201079</a> that
  describes an incorrect query result that can occur under very 
  unusual circumstances.  The ticket description contains details of the
  problem.  Suffice it to say here that the problem is very obscure and
  is unlikely to effect most applications and so upgrading is optional.
  The problem is fixed, of course, in this release.

  Upgrading from all other releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release adds two new interfaces (really just variations on existing
  interfaces).  The <a href="c3ref/create_function.html">sqlite3_create_function_v2()</a> interface adds a

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_2.html">version 3.7.2</a> fixes a long-standing bug that can cause the
  database <a href="fileformat2.html#freelist">free-page list</a> to go corrupt if <a href="pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum">incremental_vacuum</a> is used
  multiple times to
  partially reduce the size of a database file that contains many hundreds
  of unused database pages.  The original bug reports together with links
  to the patch that fixes it can be seen 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/5e10420e8d">here</a>.</p>

<p>  This bug has been in the code for at least a year and possibly longer.
  The bug has nothing to do with the versions 3.7.1 or 3.7.0 or any other
  recent release.  The fact that the bug was discovered (and fixed)
  within hours of the 3.7.1 release is purely a coincidence.</p>

<p>  The bug is impossible to hit without using <a href="pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum">incremental_vacuum</a> and is
  very difficult to hit even with incremental_vacuum.  And the kind of
  corruption that the bug causes can usually be fixed 
  simply by running <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a>.  Nevertheless, because the bug can result
  in database corruption, it is recommended that all SQLite users upgrade
  to version 3.7.2 or later.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2010_august_23"></a><h3>2010-August-23 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_1.html">Version 3.7.1</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_1.html">version 3.7.1</a> is a stabilization release for the 3.7.x series.
  Other than the filesize-in-header bug that was fixed in <a href="releaselog/3_7_0_1.html">version 3.7.0.1</a>,
  no major problems have been seen in 3.7.0.  Some minor corner-case
  performance regressions have been fixed.  A typo in the OS/2 interface
  has been repaired.</p>

<p>  A biggest part of the 3.7.1 release is a cleanup and refactoring of
  the pager module within SQLite.  This refactoring should have no
  application-visible effects.  The purpose was to reorganize the code
  in ways that make it easier to prove correctness.</p>

<p>  The 3.7.1 release adds new experimental methods for obtained more 
  detailed memory usage information and for controlling database file
  fragmentation.  And the query planner now does a better job of
  optimizing the <a href="lang_expr.html#like">LIKE</a> and <a href="lang_expr.html#glob">GLOB</a> operators.</p>

<p>  This release increases the maximum size of database pages from 32KiB to
  64KiB.  A database with 64KiB pages will not be readable or writable by
  older versions of SQLite.  Note that further increases in page size

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_0_1.html">version 3.7.0.1</a> is a patch release to fix a bug in the new
  filesize-in-header feature of the <a href="fileformat2.html">SQLite file format</a>
  that could cause database corruption if the same database file is
  written alternately with version 3.7.0 and version 3.6.23.1 or earlier.
  A performance regression was also fixed in this release.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_0.html">version 3.7.0</a> is a major release of SQLite that features
  a new transaction control mechanism using a <a href="wal.html">write-ahead log</a> or <a href="wal.html">WAL</a>.
  The traditional rollback-journal is still used as the default so there
  should be no visible change for legacy programs.  But newer programs
  can take advantage of improved performance and concurrency by enabling
  the WAL journaling mode.</p>

<p>  SQLite version 3.7.0 also contains some query planner enhancements and
  a few obscure bug fixes, but the only really big change is the addition
  of WAL mode.
